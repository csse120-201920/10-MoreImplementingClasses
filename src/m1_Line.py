        # IMPORTANT: When you test whether two FLOATING POINT numbers
        #   are "equal", you must deal with the imprecision
        #   of floating-point arithmetic.  For example, in REAL arithmetic,
        #         1 / (24 * math.pi - 20 * math.pi)
        #   and
        #         3 / (72 * math.pi - 60 * math.pi)
        #   are equal.  But in FLOATING point arithmetic, they are:
        #         0.07957747154594767
        #   and
        #         0.07957747154594765
        #   respectively (hence NOT equal).
        #   Try it out if you don't believe me!
        #
        #######################################################################
        # IMPORTANT BOTTOM-LINE:  When you want to test whether two
        # FLOATING POINT numbers  a  and  b  are the same, as in this method,
        #   DON'T use:               a == b
        #   INSTEAD use:  round(a, 12) == round(b, 12)
        ########################################################################
        #
        # The latter compares the numbers rounded to 12 decimal places.
        # In the context of this exercise, doing so is adequate to ignore
        # floating-point errors while distinguishing numbers that really
        # are different from each other.
